    <h4>Eagle Scout Project, Fall 2019</h4>
    
    <p>My project benefitted <a href="https://www.theguineapigrescue.com/" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Texas Rustlers</a>, an animal shelter for rabbits and guin. The project consisted of replacing a countertop, repainting two rooms, remodeling a bathroom, and adding purell dispensers throughout. I raised $948 going door to door and from family members. My friends, family and other scouts volunteered 63 hours over two weeks to finish the work.
        When mounting the purell dispensers, I bought surplus purell in bulk for the rescue. This resulted in a huge impact, since the covid pandemic was the next spring. The Granite countertop I installed replaced one made of fiberboard. The countertop had been a huge problem being made of fiberboard. It was water logged and leaking water to the cabinet underneath. This was the sink where all the animals, over a hundred rabbits, were bathed. This addition was a much larger problem than anticipated budget and time wise, but was an enormous help to the rescue. One of the rooms painted was the rescues store. It was important that this room looked nice, so that they could bring in more funds. Overall, It's really cool to go back and see the work I did is vital to helping them take care of the animals.

    <h4>Community Service</h4>
    <p> At Texas A&M, I enjoy volunteering at animal shelters and fostering dogs. I volunteer in <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">The Big Event</a> every year with my friends. The big event is a student-run service project that does various community service projects in the college station community. Every semester, I work to help raise money for ALS through my fraternities
         philanthropy <a href="http://support.ironphi.org/site/PageServer?pagename=LousOlympics&pw_id=5411" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Lous Olympics</a>. This was in the form of BBQ cookouts, car washes and profit shares.  Last year the fraternity raised a record of $13,971.
        <br> My goal for 2023 is to up my impact in the college station community by tutoring at local schools. I did this at my local boys and girls club in high school, and it was a great experience.
