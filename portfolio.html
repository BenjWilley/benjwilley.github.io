        <h3>NEW! <a href="http://www.wwilley.com/ReactApplication/" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">React Chat Room </a>   -   <a href="https://github.com/BenjWilley/ReactApplication" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Github Repository</a></h3>
        <p>This react application allows people to send messages in a chatroom after logging into their google account. The backend is google firebase, this allowed me to 
            add the google account authorization. I used nodejs to create the react application and deployed it using github pages. Figuring out how to configure the json files
            to work with both firebase and github pages was tricky. Im considering removing the login, so more people are open to using it.
          </p>

          <h3>Java POS with SQL backend  -  <a href="https://github.com/BenjWilley/Project2TeamRHO" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Github Repository</a></h3>
        <p>This java swing application allows employees to take orders and manage the inventory of a restaurant. 
            The menu, order history, and inventory are all SQL tables in an AWS database. We encorporated features to see trends in inventory changes and 
        order history. This project taught me a lot about planning and design since we used an agile approach.</p>


        <h3>ARM Single Cycle Processor</h3>
        <p>As part of my study abroad computer architecture class, I designed an ARM v8 processor. It ran 32 bit ARM instructions hardcoded to the verilog memory module.
             Having to design each component of the CPU as a verilog module nurtured a greater understanding of how processors work. Integration and testing sharpened my debugging skills, along with the introduction to GTK Wave.</p>
    

    
        <h3>C++ Database Program</h3>
        <p>A C++ program comprised of a client and server that used IP/TCP to send files over a network. The project increased my proficency in threading. Implementing the socket API helped me understand the TCP/IP protocol. 
            After this project, I completed a trace route program using what I learned about networking. </p>
    

        <h3>Personal Website  -  <a href="https://github.com/BenjWilley/benjwilley.github.io" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Github Repository</a></h3>
        <p> This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS. Nothing is from a template or copied. Originally, I had it hosted through A&M servers
            <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~benwilley/" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank"> here</a>. Now, it is hosted on github pages with a google domain.
             Github pages is a much better host since I can commit directly to the repository from vscode, plus it is free. Setting up the custom URL and https was challenging, but satisfying now that I have it working. 
              I plan to keep adding and making changes to this website through out my career.
