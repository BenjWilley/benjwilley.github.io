        <h3>ARM Single Cycle Processor</h3>
        <p>As part of my study abroad computer architecture class, I designed an ARM v8 processor. It ran 32 bit ARM instructions hardcoded to the verilog memory module.
             Having to design each component of the CPU as a verilog module nurtured a greater understanding of how processors work. Integration and testing sharpened my debugging skills, along with the introduction to GTK Wave.</p>
    

    
        <h3>C++ Database Program</h3>
        <p>A C++ program comprised of a client and server that used IP/TCP to send files over a network. The project increased my proficency in threading. Implementing the socket API helped me understand the TCP/IP protocol. 
            After this project, I completed a trace route program using what I learned about networking. </p>
    

        <h3>Personal Website - <a href="https://github.com/BenjWilley/benjwilley.github.io" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank">Github Repository</a></h3>
        <p> This website uses HTML, CSS, and JS. Nothing is from a template or copied. Originally, I had it hosted through A&M servers
            <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~benwilley/" class="linkColorQual" target="_blank"> here</a>. Now, it is hosted on github pages with a google domain.
             Github pages is a much better host since I can commit directly to the repository from vscode, plus it is free. Setting up the custom URL and https was challenging, but satisfying now that I have it working. 
              I plan to keep adding and making changes to this website through out my career. 
             </p>
        
    
    
        <h3>AWS and SQL Database(in progress)</h3>
        <p>This is the second project for my software engineering class. My team is making an interface for restaurant workers to manage their inventory. AWS will be used for the interface, and SQL will be used to manage the data hosted on A&M servers.   </p>
